# Kuss_Faceshield_Frame
We developed this Faceshield Frame to be injection moulded as well as 3D printed.

Spacing for the holes of the transparent plastic shield is 80mm (typical size of an european paper perforator)
You can use A4 transparent sheets (landscape orientation).
We also included a .dxf to laser/cut the shields.

Elastic Headband can be attatched.

STL file is cut off 0.7mm at the bottom to allow clean printing.
