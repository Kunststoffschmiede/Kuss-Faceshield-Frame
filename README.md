# Kuss_Faceshield_Frame
We developed this Faceshield Frame to be injection moulded as well as 3D printed.

Spacing for the holes of the transperent plastic shield is 80mm (typical size of an european paper perforator)

Elastic Headband can be attatched.

STL file is cut off 0.7mm at the bottom to allow clean printing.
