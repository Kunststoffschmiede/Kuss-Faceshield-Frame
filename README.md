# Kuss Faceshield Frame

// Please use recycled material for production! 

Even though time is pressing, we strongly advise against the use of virgin plastic. Our climate and environment should not be suffering from our health! There are plenty of high quality secondary materials available. 

If you are struggling to obtain some in your area (Germany/Austria/Switzerland + possibly rest of Europe), we can help! Please get in touch: info@kunststoffschmiede.org // +49 172 1407156

For the rest of the world please visit cirplus.com (for injections moulding pellets)


// Product Info:

We optimized this Faceshield Frame to be injection moulded. Use the .step file from the folder to design the mould.

Furthermore we developed a 3D printing optimized version of the model. Use the .STL file from the folder for that.

The plastic sheet can be lasercutted out of 0.4-0.8 mm thick sheet of PET. Us the provided .DXF for that.
If you dont have a lasercutter you can use an A4 size sheet and a paper perforator (with 80 mm hole spacing)

Elastic Headband can be attatched as well.
